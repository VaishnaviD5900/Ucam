Based on the data that needs to be viewed, the respective component is called and its corresponding data is presented to the user.\n For example: Consider the “analysis component”, \n analysis : On providing the start date and the end date, line chart with entry, exit and average is loaded and the device name, the total entries and the total exits in the given date range are displayed. The loaded chart and the data in the given date range can be downloaded as excel or pdf.\n analysis.component.css: Contains the styles for the html\n analysis.component.html: It contains the structure of the analysis web-page (the excel and pdf buttons, the canvas)\n chartmodel.ts: It is a class that is instantiated whenever chart object is created that is further used to store data retrieved from api and plots the required graph.\n analysis.component.ts: In the submit function the data is being fetched and assigned to labels and data for the chart.\n downloadPdf(): function creates a pdf with the chart and helps in downloading the pdf.\n downloadExcel(): function creates an excel with the chart and helps in downloading the excel.\n Similarly the working is depicted in other components based on the data.\n compare-monthly: It shows the comparison between the averages of the current month and the previous month in the form of a line chart which can be downloaded as an  excel or a pdf.\n compare-weekly: It shows the contrast between the averages, the entries and the exits of the current week and the previous week in the form of a line chart that can be downloaded as an excel or a pdf.\n compare-yearly: It presents the juxtaposition of the averages of the current year and the previous year in a line chart that can be downloaded as an excel or a pdf.\n quarterly:  Quarterly averages are plotted in a line chart that can be easily downloaded as an excel or a pdf.\n yearly: Yearly averages are plotted in a line chart which can be downloaded as an excel or a pdf.\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nTo change the URL of API\nOpen assets/config.json  and edit the API_URL with the URL of your choice.\nTo add new APIs\nOpen services/web-server.service.ts and add the required API.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n
